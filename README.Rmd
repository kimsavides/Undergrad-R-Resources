## Intro 💡

*R is hard.* At first especially. But, R can be hard for pros too, and that's ok. Programming languages and the tools we use in them are constantly evolving and changing–often for the better. If you step away from coding for some time, a week when you are starting out, a month or a year after getting into the groove, you will come back and probably feel everything is confusing again. That is also ok. It happens to all of us, especially ecologists who do not usually think "in code" like many computer scientists do. **All of this is ok!**

Getting a solid foundation as you learn R and knowing where to look for help is key. Staying organized and documenting what you are doing and why is also key. Do these things and I promise, everything will be ok–probably better than ok!

## Why R? Why GitHub? Why....? 🧐

Well, to be bluntly honest, if you want to do science this is now the requirement. A few years ago, if you knew how to do a bit of R coding, you were primed for getting that postdoc position. Then, a few years later it was expected for incoming PhD students, now if you want to be competitive for a MS position? You guessed it, you need to be proficient in R, and GitHub doesn't hurt either. Proficient doesn't mean an expert, though. It means you know your way around, can access data, tidy that data, clean it, summarize it in tables/figures, and know how to fix errors and where to look for advise. That is totally achievable.

**So, why R?** Doesn't Excel do the same things? Kind of....for some things. Can Excel fidn the min/max/mean, make so graphs, and do some calculations–sure. But R is so much more. R is free, open source, is way more powerful, and has a community of people always working on making new things and fixing what's broken. But most importantly, R makes you work **reproducible**. Reproducability is now key to all science. I should be able to take someone else's data, run their script (the code they wrote), and get the same results they did–that's reproducuability. This ensures others can check our work, expand on what we did, and be transparent about how we handled our data.

In R, we take data, run it through a script (the code), and produce results. We can do this again and again, and we should get the same result. Every data cleaning step, tidying step, analysis step, and figure production is written out in code. This is where things really differ from Excel. In Excel you will need to do a lot of individual tasks, probably saving a munch of data files in between with weird names like "data_clean.csv", then "data_clean_v2.csv". Then when you are nearly finished, you will realize you forgot something or need to redo something else. Which file do you go back to? Do you remember what you did exactly? Can you reproduce what you did previously? I'm pretty sure the answer will be "no" – because I've done that and you probably have to in some way or another. R scripts are designed to take the raw data, clean it, do whatever else you need, and give you a product at the end. All the steps are there to see, to be explained, and to be runable again and again as we tweak things towards our final product. That's why R is important to learn and use (among many other things that is).

**Why GitHub?** Good question. It's been the industry standard for computer scientists (think software develeopers, game designers) for a long time, and its now becoming the best practice for R coding as well. GitHub is the Google Docs of coding. Basically it is "version control" and tracks the changes in code between versions. If something was working before, and its not working now, you can see what changed in the code. Like Google Docs, its also cloud storage for your code. If your computer up and dies, your code is safe and sound in the cloud on GitHub. This has saved many an R coder before and will in the future too. Do you need to totally understand Git and GitHub to use it? *No, definetly not, that's mostly for developers and industry folks*. Do you need to use it in your coding workflows for ecological data? *Yes* [^1]. Learn and use it now to set yourself up better for the future.

[^1]: ok, you got me. Technically no, but YES. Trust me, just do it!

## R Building Blocks 🧱

### R Projects

When you produce work for a class, you probably keep things in folders. Like "Documents/Cornell/Ornithology/Lab_1/" where all your data and write ups and such for Lab 1 are stored. If you want to work on Lab 1, your fundamental unit would be the Lab_1 folder—everything you need for Lab 1 is in there. In R, our fundamental unit is called a "project". A project is a folder that contains everything we need to do our analysis—the rest of our computer does not matter, its like it does not exist. When you create a project in R, it creates a folder and makes a file with the folder name with the extension `.Rproj` . This is the magic. Double click that file and your project loads right up and R now knows that we are working on this thing in this location and we only need to worry about what is here. If you use a project, finding files and saving things will be so much better, trust me! No more, "where did that save?", "where did I put that data?". Its all right here, in the project. And, the best part? Throw this on github, have someone else clone it, and they are good to go! All the file paths will work. They won't need to change your code where you read the data in from your "C://user/Documents/I_want_this_folder/... .csv" to "C://user/Document/well_I_wanted_to_use_this_folder/... .csv". Again, reproducability!

Projects are just folders with a .Rproj file int it. Each project should be a——well, a project. We have an eoclogical question we want to answer, that's our project. Our R project should reflect that. A data analyst has lots of different R projects, each with its own task. You don't want a huge R project that spans multiple quetsions or multiple ideas. We want managable units that can be self contained, runable from data to product, and be sharable! So, you might have a project `2026-FeederWatch-ChickadeesTrends` for looking at trends in chickadee abunance over time, and `2026-NestWatch-RobinSuccess` for looking at nesting success of Robins. Each will have starting data, analysis code, and final products. Even if you share starting data, or even some analysis, different main questions use different projects: `2026-NestWatch-RobinSuccess` and `2026-NestWatch-NestUsurption` may both share the NestWatch dataset, but one might be asking what species usurp (take-over) nests of other species while the other is asking how has American Robin nesting success changed over space and time. Different question = Different R project. And everything we need to get from data to our final product should be in our project.

### R Scripts

The other main unit in R is the "script". Scripts hold code, its where the magic happens. Scripts tell R where to get data from, what to do with it (and how), and how we want to see what we produced along the way. Think of the script as the instruction manual for not only R, but also you and someone else. That's the today you, the tomorrow you, and the you ten years from now. Scripts contain code to do things, but they also contain comments! Commenting out your code makes a good coder great! Code is for the computer, but comments are for humans.

``` r
# This is a comment, the line starts with a #
# The next line is code, it doesn't start with a #
1+2

1+2   # you can add comments after code too!
```

### Project Structure 🗂️

Organization is key—for most things, R projected included. And like most things, there are some standard conventions that make things easier and more familiar when working collaboratively. If stop lights were red in one state and blue in anther, that would be confusing, right? Same thing for R projects. We usually use the following structure:

![](figures/project_structure.png)

Here we see in R the contents of our project folder. This folder lives on my computer in the folder "Small Projects" and the project is called "Undergrad-R-Resources". We see everything in that folder. Lets break down what is here, some of it I made, some of it is automatic, but all of these are standard practice among R coders who make good, reproducbale code workflows.

-   Undergrad-R-Resources.Rproj This is the project file, the glue that holds everything together

-   README.Rmd Where I am typing right now, it explains what the project is about

-   README.md This is what actually renders on the github page form the README

-   .Rhistory Not really that important

-   .gitignore Tells github what to not worry about (like data to large or sensitive)

-   data-raw Folder holding RAW DATA ONLY (your starting point, your fallback)

-   data Folder holding any processed data (cleaned, subset, etc.)

-   scripts Folder holding scripts (each should be numbered and named well)

-   figures Folder holding all your figures (formatted tables often go here too)

-   (docs) Sometimes you may see a docs folder, for docs like manuscipts

-   (spatial) If you have spatial data, keep that separate, those files are huge

-   (results) Sometimes used to store final products of analyses (like final data)

The .Rhistory, .gitignore, README, and the project file are all automatically created when you create the project or get it setup on GitHub. Don't change their location. You create the folders and populate them with the data and code. The important thing here is everything lives in a folder and each folder has a purpose. And the most important thing is that `data-raw` and `data` are different. Your starting data (raw data) goes in `data-raw`. This is your starting point and your fall back. It doesn't matter if your starting data is technically pre-processed (most data is to some degree) or is truly raw—all starting data that you are working with goes here. We read in the raw data, transform it in some way (liek filterign or cleaning) and we save that data as a new file in `data`. Never write over files in `data-raw` and never save processes data in `data-raw`—NO EXCEPTIONS. (As a data scientist I don't choose many hills to die on, but if there's one then this is the one).

`scripts` will hold all your scripts, from downloading data, to cleaning, to analysis, and to producing your final thing. That thing could be some figures, or some tables, or a combination of both. You should have multiple scripts. Your project is your overall question. Your individual scripts contain tasks that are necessary to answer that question. I usually have at least three scripts. Each script should be numbered so you know what order they happen in and should be names in a way that tells you what question and what task are we working on. I usually use the following convention:

-   01-ShortProjectName-dataclean

-   02-ShortProjectName-specificanaysis

-   03-ShortProjectName-specificfigure

By looking at the file name, we can see the order in which we need to run the scripts, what question they answer (in case they end up in a weird spot outside our project folder), and what is being done in the script. Data cleaning scripts take the raw data, process it into something usable for our question and save that new file in `data`. Then any analysis scripts use that processed data file, do an analysis, produce a or many results, and store those results. Different analyses should have different scripts. Then figure scripts take results and produce nice looking products like formatted tables or figures. If you want to change the font size of your figure, you don't necessarily want to rerun all your analyses. Keeping a separate figure script is unbelievably helpful.
